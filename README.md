# Compiler

For this project, I am attempting to learn the in's and out's of compilers. 

In essense, a compiler has these elements: 

- Parsing
- Resolution of References to other Modules
- Semantic Validation
- Equivalent Transformation & High-Level Optimization
- Code Generation
- Peephole Optimization

# Terminology Breakdown:

### Parsing:

> To break down and categorizing language into its individual components. 

In English, we use `Subject -> Verb -> Object`

Example: `She (subject) planted (verb) seeds (object).`

# Resolution of References 

# Semantic Evaluation 

# Equivalent Transformation

# High Level Optimization 

# Code Generation

# Peephole Optimization
