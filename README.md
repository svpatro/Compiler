# Compiler

For this project, I am attempting to learn the in's and out's of compilers.

# How To Run

To compile the project, run `make compiler`

To run the project, run `./compiler`

# Documentation

In essense, a compiler has these elements: 

- Lexical Analysis
- Syntax Analysis
- Semantic Analysis
- Code Generation
- Code Optimization

# Terminology Breakdown:

### Lexical Analysis:

> To break down and categorizing language into its individual components. 

In English, we use `Subject -> Verb -> Object`

Example: `She (subject) planted (verb) seeds (object).`

### Syntactic Analysis

### Semantic Evaluation: 

> Syntax is the concept that concerns itself only where or not the sentence is valid for the grammar of the langauge. Symantics, however, is about whether the sentence has a valid meaning. 

In other words, syntax is concern about the stucture of the language whereas symantics is concern about whether the language makes sense. 

By reason, we can conclude that semantic evaluation is the process of determining whether the language makes sense in context. 

### Code Generation:

### Code Optimization:
