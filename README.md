# Compiler

For this project, I am attempting to learn the in's and out's of compilers. 

In essense, a compiler has these elements: 

- Parsing
- Resolution of References to other Modules
- Semantic Validation
- Equivalent Transformation & High-Level Optimization
- Code Generation
- Peephole Optimization

Quite frankly, I have no clue what the majority of these terms mean yet, so I will define them below: 

**Parsing** - 




**Resolution of References** - 


**Semantic Evaluation** - 



**Equivalent Transformation** - 

**High Level Optimization** - 

**Code Generation** - 

**Peephole Optimization** -
